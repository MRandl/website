            Hi! I am Mathis Randl, a PhD student in the SaCS lab at EPFL. I do
            research at the intersection of databases and machine learning, with
            a focus on improving the scalability and efficiency of large-scale
            inference.

            These days, I'm (for the most part) working on software techniques
            for approximate vector search. Systems based on exotic hardware for
            vector retrieval are also in the works.
        </p>
