        Hi! I am Mathis Randl, a PhD student in the SaCS lab at EPFL. I do
        research at the intersection of databases and machine learning, with a
        focus on improving the scalability and efficiency of large-scale
        inference.
    </p>
    <p>
        These days, I'm (for the most part) working on software techniques for
        approximate vector search. Systems based on exotic hardware for vector
        retrieval are also in the works.
    </p>

        This website is meant to store my CV/resume, as well as archive papers,
        blog posts and announcements related to my professional works. Feel free
        to explore around!
